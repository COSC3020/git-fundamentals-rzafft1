# **My Profile**

## About me 
- I am almost 21 years old, and am in my third year of computer science
- I grew up in Laramie Wyoming, right on the edge of town, and have lived 
here my whole life
- Throughout my childhood I spent most of my time either playing hockey 
and traveling, or spending time outside hiking, backpacking, rafting, and 
camping.
- I always worked hard in school, however I didnt discover my love for 
computer science until my second semester of college when I decided to 
take a cosc-1010 class. I was challenged immediatley, and realized that 
the area sparked my interest and work ethic more than most classes I had 
taken at the time. So the summer between my freshman and sophmore year of 
college, I spent day after day learning about the fundamentals of python, 
html, c++ and java, and before I knew it, I was sucked in and knew that 
computer science was my calling. 
- Latley I have spent a lot of time in the data science and a machine 
learning area. I really enjoy manipulating data, finding patterns, and 
making observations and predictions with intresting data sets. 
- Although I am guiding my career towards the data science realm, I am 
intrested in many areas of computer science and have not yet made a 
decision on what I will pursue in the future. Cyber secuity, front end 
design, and software development and testing are all areas I am intrested 
in as well. 
- Besides my intersts in computer science I still enjoy playing hockey, 
learning the guitar, and traveling. 

## Understand Github
- In the past year or two, I have used git hub quite a bit
- I am comfterable with cloning repos, adding files, pushing changes and 
making commits
- Here I did 'git clone [repo name]' ... 'nano Profile.md' ... 'git add 
Profile.md' ... 'git commit -m "added Profile.md' ... 'git push'... when 
using get push it will request a username [rzafft1] and a personal token, 
that can be created and copied in the devloper section of our profile 
setting on github
